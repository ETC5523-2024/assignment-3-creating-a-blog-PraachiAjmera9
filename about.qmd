I am a student at Monash University pursuing a Master's in Business Analytics. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering in India, where I built a strong foundation in programming and data structures. I'm eager to learn and gain experience in business analytics, and I enjoy working with Python, R, and SQL. I'm excited to explore machine learning and data mining. In my free time, I play badminton and read, which helps me stay balanced and curious.
