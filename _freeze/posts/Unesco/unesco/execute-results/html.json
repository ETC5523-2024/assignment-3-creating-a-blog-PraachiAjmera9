By analyzing visualizations, we uncover how different regions contribute to the global heritage landscape, the evolution of heritage site inscriptions, and the distribution across various categories. These insights reveal both the rich global heritage and key factors driving these trends.\n\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites are valued for their global significance, showcasing humanity's cultural and natural legacy. By examining trends and regional distribution, we can understand global heritage preservation efforts and see how different regions contribute to this legacy. This analysis aims to reveal these trends and offer a clear view of how heritage sites are spread and classified worldwide.\n\n\n1. **Trends in World Heritage Sites Inscribed Each Year by Region** \n\nThe time series plot in @fig-yearlytrends reveals how the number of World Heritage Sites inscribed each year varies by region.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Number of Heritage Sites Inscribed Each Year by Region](unesco_files/figure-html/fig-yearlytrends-1.png){#fig-yearlytrends width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key Observations**:\n\n+ *Asia and the Pacific*: A consistent rise in site inscriptions showcases growing global recognition of the region's heritage.\n+ *Europe and North America & Latin America and the Caribbean*: Peaks around 1998-2005 indicate periods of intensified heritage recognition and conservation efforts.\n+ *Africa and Arab States*: A notable decrease suggests challenges in site preservation or documentation in these regions.\n+ *Comparative Trends*: Europe and North America, along with Asia and the Pacific, lead in the number of sites, while Africa lags behind.\n\n2. **Distribution of Heritage Sites by Region and Category**\n\nThe @fig-regioncategory provides a horizontal bar chart detailing the distribution of World Heritage Sites by region and category. This visualization illustrates how sites are classified and distributed globally.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Number of Heritage Sites by Region and Category](unesco_files/figure-html/fig-regioncategory-1.png){#fig-regioncategory width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key Insights**:\n\n+ *Cultural Sites*: Predominantly concentrated in Europe and North America, reflecting a strong cultural heritage presence.\n+ *Natural Sites*: Significant in Asia and the Pacific as well as Europe and North America, highlighting diverse natural landscapes.\n+ *Cultural/Natural Sites*: Most common in Asia and the Pacific, where Europe and North America is also in the lead behind, both showing a blend of cultural and natural heritage.\n+ *Underrepresented Regions*: Arab States and Africa have fewer natural and cultural/natural sites, indicating potential areas for increased focus.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'kableExtra'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    group_rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Summary table by region and category\nsimple_table <- heritage_clean %>%\n  group_by(REGION, CATFIN_FULL) %>%\n  summarise(Total_Sites = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = CATFIN_FULL, values_from = Total_Sites) %>%\n  replace(is.na(.), 0)  # Replace NA with 0 for better display\n\n# Display the table\nsimple_table\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nSimple feature collection with 19 features and 5 fields\nGeometry type: GEOMETRY\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -179.7153 ymin: -54.59472 xmax: 178.8345 ymax: 71.18889\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n# A tibble: 19 × 6\n   REGION                           geometry Cultural `Cultural/Natural` Natural\n * <chr>                      <GEOMETRY [°]>    <int>              <int>   <int>\n 1 Africa          MULTIPOINT ((-23.60519 1…       48                  0       0\n 2 Africa          MULTIPOINT ((-3.41667 14…        0                  5       0\n 3 Africa          MULTIPOINT ((-16.16667 1…        0                  0      24\n 4 Africa          MULTIPOINT ((-12.71667 1…        0                  0       0\n 5 Arab States     MULTIPOINT ((-5.36667 35…       73                  0       0\n 6 Arab States     MULTIPOINT ((9 25.5), (3…        0                  3       0\n 7 Arab States     MULTIPOINT ((-16.10889 2…        0                  0       5\n 8 Asia and the P… MULTIPOINT ((115.4028 -8…      172                  0       0\n 9 Asia and the P… MULTIPOINT ((131 -25.333…        0                 12       0\n10 Asia and the P… MULTIPOINT ((113.4361 -2…        0                  0      60\n11 Asia and the P… MULTIPOINT ((101.5 -2.5)…        0                  0       0\n12 Europe and Nor… MULTIPOINT ((-27.22 38.6…      425                  0       0\n13 Europe and Nor… MULTIPOINT ((-5e-04 42.6…        0                 10       0\n14 Europe and Nor… MULTIPOINT ((-9.928611 -…        0                  0      61\n15 Europe and Nor… POINT (-80.99639 25.5544…        0                  0       0\n16 Latin America … MULTIPOINT ((-43.29139 -…       96                  0       0\n17 Latin America … MULTIPOINT ((-76.57111 1…        0                  5       0\n18 Latin America … MULTIPOINT ((-32.42511 -…        0                  0      35\n19 Latin America … MULTIPOINT ((-84.675 15.…        0                  0       0\n# ℹ 1 more variable: `Not Designated` <int>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n###### **Data source** : \n\nData was sourced from the [UNESCO World Heritage Sites dataset](https://ihp-wins.unesco.org/dataset/unesco-world-heritage-sites), which includes comprehensive information about World Heritage Sites globally.\n\n###### **Data dictionary** : \n\n1.
